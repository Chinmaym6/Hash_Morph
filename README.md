<h1> AI Task Allocation Agent </h1>
This AI Task Allocation Agent optimizes the assignment of tasks to employees by leveraging their expertise, availability, workload, and project priorities. Hereâ€™s an overview of the process:

<h1>Project Requirement Extraction</h1>
Automated Expertise Identification: Utilizes Azure DeepSeek to analyze task descriptions, extracting required skill sets and necessary headcount automatically. This ML-driven approach ensures precision in matching project needs with the right expertise.

Fallback Mechanism: In cases where Azure DeepSeek does not provide complete or successful results, manual input is available to ensure no task goes unattended.

<h1>Optimal Employee Matching</h1>
Scoring System: Employees are scored based on various attributes including:

-> Performance Rating

-> Years of Experience

-> Communication Skills

-> Task Completion Rate

-> Current Workload

-> Availability

Priority and Urgency Consideration: Tasks are assigned with consideration to the urgency (high, medium, low) and proximity of due dates, ensuring critical projects are prioritized.

Manual Overrides: Managers can specify certain employees to be included in specific tasks, providing flexibility and control over the allocation process.
A detailed expertise-mapping file ensures accurate and consistent identification of skills across diverse domains like Web Development, DevOps, ML, UI/UX, Security, and more.

Real-time Availability and Workload Management:
Daily Refresh: An automated daily refresh adjusts employee availability and workload in real-time based on ongoing project due dates and existing workloads, utilizing APScheduler for these updates.

Workload Adjustments: After task assignments, the system automatically updates the workload metrics to reflect the new status, ensuring data accuracy.

Comprehensive Expertise Mapping:
Extensive Domain Coverage: An expertise mapping file covers a wide range of skills from Web Development to Security, ensuring accurate alignment of tasks to employee skills.

<h1> Algorithm Details</h1>
Employee Ranking and Matching: A weighted scoring system ranks employees, and a Hungarian algorithm-inspired approach ensures optimal matching by minimizing allocation inefficiency.

Dynamic Allocation Based on Project Priority:

High Priority: Immediate assignment of tasks, prioritizing employees with the highest scores and nearest availability.

Medium Priority: Balances between optimal matching and due date proximity, ensuring efficient use of resources without compromising project timelines.

Low Priority: More flexible in assignment timings, allowing for optimization of workload distribution across available employees.
